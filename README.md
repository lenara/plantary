Minting a plant
-

Each plant has different minting fees. For example:

- random plant: 10
- money plant: 15
- oracle plant: 20
- portrait plant: 25

Plant DNA
-

When a plant is minted it will have a type and also a unique DNA string, which will have an influence on what the plant can do. 


Harvests
-

Plants can give harvests. The type of plant defines the kind of harvest. The portrait plant allows you to mint portaits. The oracle plant allows you to mint fortunes. You need to own at least one oracle plant to be able to mint fortunes, and at least one portrait plant in order to mint portraits. The money plant does not give harvests.

Harvest mints carry a fee depending on the type of harvest. Example:

- each fortune harvest: 5
- each portrait harvest: 10

The DNA of the plants you own influence the types of harvest you can get (rarity and other qualities). You can select from the plants you have which ones you want to use to influence each harvest mint.

Rarity
-

Harvests have different levels or rarity. Example:

- standard harvest - common
- special harvest - rare
- power harvest - ultra rare
- unique harvest - legendary
- magic harvest - mythic

Some plants and combination of plants will produce a higher amount of rare harvest mints.

Sell and trade NFTs
-

Both plants and harvests are unique NFTs that can be sold or traded. 


Collect Art
-

The plant NFT images will feature commissioned art from different artists. Plantary will open submissions for artists to send plant artwork. After submissions are approved, artists get a commission on first sales, and royalties on further secondary market sales.
